# Schedule Subsystem Configuration
# Defines task types and their dedicated thread pool sizes
#
# YAML Structure:
#   task_types:
#     - type: <string>        # Task type identifier (used in RunnableTask constructor)
#       threads: <int>         # Number of dedicated worker threads for this type
#       description: <string>  # Optional: human-readable description
#
# DESIGN NOTES:
# - Each task type gets a dedicated thread pool for isolation
# - Thread count should match workload characteristics:
#   * CPU-bound tasks: num_cores or num_cores - 1
#   * I/O-bound tasks: higher count (e.g., 2-4x num_cores)
#   * Latency-critical: dedicated single thread
# - Total threads across all types should not exceed 2-3x CPU core count

task_types:
  # Generic tasks: CPU-bound work, miscellaneous operations
  - type: Generic
    threads: 4
